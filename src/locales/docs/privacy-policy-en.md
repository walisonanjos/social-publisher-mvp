**Effective Date:** June 21, 2025

Welcome to Social Publisher MVP ("we," "our," or "the application"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use our services. By using Social Publisher MVP, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect different types of information to provide and improve our service to you.
* **a) Information You Provide:**
  * **Account Data:** When you register, we collect your email address and name.
  * **User Content:** We collect the video files, titles, descriptions, and scheduling times you provide to us for publication.
* **b) Information Collected from Third Parties (with your permission):**
  * When you connect your social media accounts (such as YouTube or TikTok), we gain access to your basic profile information and, crucially, to the authorization tokens (`access_token` and `refresh_token`) required to publish content on your behalf. We do not store your passwords for these platforms.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
* **To Provide and Maintain our Service:** The primary purpose is to perform the core function of our application: to schedule and publish your video content to the platforms you have connected, at the time you have designated.
* **To Manage Your Account:** We use your data to identify you, allow login, and ensure the security of your account.
* **To Communicate with You:** We may use your email address to send you important information about your account, service updates, or to respond to your support requests.

## 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal information. The sharing of your data is limited to the following scenarios and third-party service providers that help us operate:
* **Social Media Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, etc.):** We share your video content and associated metadata (title, description) with the platforms you have authorized, for the sole purpose of carrying out the publication on your behalf.
* **Infrastructure Providers:** We use third-party services for the technical operation of our platform: Vercel (hosting), Supabase (database and authentication), and Cloudinary (video storage).

## 4. Data Storage and Security
We take the security of your data seriously. Your access tokens are stored in an encrypted form in our database. We use service providers with high security standards. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. Your Rights and Control
You have control over your personal information: you can access and edit your scheduled content, disconnect your social media accounts, and request the deletion of your account by contacting us.
